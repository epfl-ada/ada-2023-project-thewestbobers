## Abstract

Pivotal movie is a movie that has influenced the industry in the subsequent years of its release, by creating a trend. In this project, we want to analyse which film of cinema industry can be qualified as pivotal. To determine it, we will analyse features of films 

our first approach is to analyze the distribution over time of a subset (eg. genre), and identify whether an unusual shape occurs, such as a bump and high variations.
The idea would be then to select a range of movies prior to the peak, and compare their box offices and reviews. Then, we could draw from this range the pivotal movie that may have produced the particular shape.
